### **About:** 
The task was to write a delivery fee calculator. I used FastAPI because its intuitive, requires less code, and as the name suggests its fast! Additionally, I wrote several tests with Pytest that check the basic functinality and some edge cases.

## **Testing**
You can either test the api with FastAPI docs:

Sample request:
```
{
    "cart_value": 790,
    "delivery_distance": 2235,
    "amount_of_items": 4,
    "time": "2021-10-12T13:00:00Z"
}
```
Output:
```
{"delivery_fee":710}
```

## **Pytest**

Alternatively you can use the tests in test_fees.py by running "pytest" command in the project folder.

```
pytest
```
